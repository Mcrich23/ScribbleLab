ScribbleLab's developer documentation

## Overview

Welcome Devs and SL Contributors, This is our Developer documentation that helps our you to understand how our App works in detail.
ScribbleLab is a powerful text editor built by students, for students, written entirely and unapologetically for iOS, iPadOS and macOS. Features include timetables, reminders, study timers, cloud storage support for 3rd party companies like Google and Apple (iCloudDrive), homework module, powerful text editor, extensions (macOS), live collaboration (soon available) and more.

> ScribbleLab is currently in development and not yet ready for production use. You are welcome to test the latest [dev build](https://github.com/ScribbleLabApp/ScribbleLab/releases/latest) at your own risk. Please leave any feedback [here](https://github.com/ScribbleLabApp/ScribbleLab/issues). Or build your own version of it `(only development usage)`!



## Mission
Our mission at ScribbleLab is to create an app that makes everyday life easier for many students. 
As a student, you often need to use different apps to organize your academic life. So, we decided to integrate four existing apps, namely Reminder, Calendar, Timetable, and Clock, into one app. We also gave it a new, visually appealing design and a seamless integration into our editor.

By creating our own text editor, we were able to design it with our workflow in mind and customize its features to our exact specifications. We made sure that the editor was **lightweight but yet powerful**, **fast**, and **user-friendly**.

We strive to remain true to Apple's human interface guidelines and development patterns, ensuring ScribbleLab looks and feels like an application developed by Apple themselves, which includes a meticulous attention to detail.

## Features
To fulfill our mission, we must provide our users with ...
1. ... a visual appealing design.
2. ... a great user experience.
3. ... awsome features that simplify our user's lives.

To enhance the visual appeal of our application, we put careful consideration into its design, resulting in a cute and well-coordinated color scheme.

To ensure a great user experience, we strictly follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and development patterns. 

Finally, as a student, you may find many apps with great features, but none that meet all your needs. That's where ScribbleLab comes in handy. Our app provides a comprehensive suite of powerful and useful tools. We offer our users access to:
- a customizable timetable function
- a fully customizable Calender
- a study timer
- a reminder and homework to-do lists
- live collaborations `(soon avaiale)`
- linking cloud storage from 3rd party companies like Dropbox, GoogleDrive, iCloudDrive, ...
- customizable templates (pages, covers)
- import and export PDF's, and .scribble `(own file fromat soon available)` files
- AI support `(ScribbleLab Pro only - soon available)`
- Widgets:
    - Study Timer widget
    - calender widget
    - reminder and homework to-do widget

You might wonder, "How can an app be good if it has so many features? Is there a catch?" Our response is no. At ScribbleLab, we believe that our app improves with every feature we add. The purpose of ScribbleLab is to provide a platform where you can make notes related to school, work, or personal life ("scribble") and explore the various features we have to offer and customize them ("Lab"). You may wonder how we can provide users with a straightforward graphical interface, but we have that covered too. To keep the UI simple we moved some of the features into the Side Bar where you can acess it with a simple click.

But you might wonder "How are they capable of adapting the features to their customers?" - Well the answer is this, we use the feedback from our community and testers.
