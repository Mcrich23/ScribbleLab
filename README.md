## Motivation
We at ScribbleLab found that the existing text editors in the market were either too complicated, lacked essential features, or were difficult to customize for our specific needs. We thought "Why isn't there an app that has everything you need?" and that's why we decided to create our own text editor. We wanted the complete control over its functionality and features.

## Mission
Our mission at ScribbleLab is to create an app that makes everyday life easier for many students. 
As a student, you often need to use different apps to organize your academic life. So, we decided to integrate four existing apps, namely Reminder, Calendar, Timetable, and Clock, into one app. We also gave it a new, visually appealing design and a seamless integration into our editor.

By creating our own text editor, we were able to design it with our workflow in mind and customize its features to our exact specifications. We made sure that the editor was **lightweight but yet powerful**, **fast**, and **user-friendly**.
