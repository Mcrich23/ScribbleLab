# Security Policy

Privacy is a fundamental right and should be treated with utmost importance. When it comes to personal data, it is important that it is stored securely and responsibly. 
Therefore we're storing your data on your device or on your iCloud/GoogleDrive/Dropbox account, ensuring that the data is not accessible to unauthorized individuals or entities.

At the same time, it is crucial that individuals have control over their data. They should be able to access and manage their data easily, 
as well as have the option to delete it if they so choose. This is especially important in the context of data breaches, 
where personal information can fall into the wrong hands. But with ScribbleLab it isn't possible accept someone hacks your device or cloud and steals your data.

### Special note for the linking of Cloud services to ScibbleLab:
When you link a cloud service to ScribbleLab you agree to their LICENSE of that specific Service. 

> "Can we see or acces your cloud or device data?"
The answer is no.
